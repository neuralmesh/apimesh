# apimesh

apimesh is a self-improving, automated problem-solving system that composes Large Language Models (LLMs) and software automation methods to write and execute workflows.

These workflows can trigger additional automation processes, enabling a recursive, self-replicating mechanism. This capability allows the system to adapt and improve over time autonomously.
