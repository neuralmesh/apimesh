# Objective

Develop an Automated Problem-Solving Tool Using Language Models

## Key Results

1. Use large language models for automatic identification and resolution of problems.
2. Create an automation engine to execute and record solutions with limited user input.
3. Employ version control and use pull requests for proposed solution integration.
4. Reduce dependency on external communication for problem-solving by 95%.
5. Incorporate user feedback for continuous improvement of the tool's effectiveness.
6. Showcase three practical applications created using this tool.

## Context

The goal is to automatically generate bash scripts that can do everything.
Because in the end this is the easiest most human readable way to do everything.
Developers can develop everything with just cli tools.
Therefore there is no reason as to why this cant work.
Keep that in mind when designing your bash scripts!
