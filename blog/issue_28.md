## Enhancing Project Success & User Development Experience 

Significantly improving your personal experiences and optimizing development procedures with the enhancement of issue sorting. Users require the ability to sort issues based on recent activity, presenting an opportunity to streamline bug tracking and issue resolution. 

This feature is critical to ensuring the continuity of the project. It aids in effective issue prioritization, prevents potential disruptions, and minimally impacts developer productivity. This efficiency increment eliminates unnecessary delays, and by keeping the project on track, it improves the overall job security for contributors. 

On the technical end, a potential solution lies with the integration of a `--fix` command within the CLI. This flag works towards automatically rectifying issues while preserving the existing command structure. Its implementation, with large language models as personal assistants, furnishes a seamless and dynamic integration that can keep the repositories updated, allowing users to focus on creating novel tools.
